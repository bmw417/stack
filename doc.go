Package stack aims to provide a fast, simple, thread safe, and generic golang stack library
to the public. It uses as few linking libraries as possible, and the ones it does are 
common standard libraries for a smaller code footprint and greater performance.

Each Stack is generically compatible, meaning that any data can be added and retrieved to/from a Stack.
Locks are also used on Stack objects when modifying the Stack through using the Pop or Push methods, so
that Stack objects are thread safe.
